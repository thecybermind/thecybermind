Hello, I am Kevin Masterson.

My longtime project has been QMM. It is a dynamic plugin manager for games based on the Quake 3 (and Quake 2!) engine. It functions similar to [Metamod](http://metamod.org/) for Half-Life and [Metamod:Source](https://www.sourcemm.net/) for the Source engine (Half-Life 2).

I began writing it while at University of Maryland in 2004, and it was originally hosted on SourceForge, then also on PlanetQuake.

Eventually, I stopped working on it, and then after SourceForge went downhill, I made repos here on GitHub, but otherwise left them untouched. I have since (Mar 2025) begun working on QMM (and various plugins) again.

Take a look at some of the QMM repos:
* [QMM2](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/) - The main plugin manager
* [Stub_QMM](https://github.com/thecybermind/stub_qmm/) - A basic sample plugin
* [RocketMod_QMM](https://github.com/thecybermind/rocketmod_qmm/) - A simple "Rocket Launcher-only" game mode plugin for Quake 3 Arena
* [Stripper_QMM](https://github.com/thecybermind/stripper_qmm/) - A plugin that dynamically modifies map entities during loading. Similar to [Stripper2](http://hpb-bot.bots-united.com/stripper2.html) for Half-Life and [Stripper:Source](https://www.bailopan.net/stripper/) for Source engine games
* [qvmops](https://github.com/thecybermind/qvmops/) - A simple CLI [QVM](https://github.com/thecybermind/qmm2/wiki/QVM) disassembler

Take a look at some of my other projects:

* [FRSScan](https://github.com/thecybermind/frsscan/) - Flipper Zero app to scan FRS channels for activity
* [SteelSeriesGG Helper] (https://github.com/thecybermind/steelseriesgg_helper) - Simple script to reset settings in the Sonar section of the SteelSeries GG app
* [ipredir](https://github.com/thecybermind/ipredir/) - IP redirection+NAT for Windows
* [QuestNoise](https://github.com/thecybermind/questnoise/) - World of Warcraft addon that plays a sound when you have made objective progress, completed an objective, or completed a quest
* [HideHotKeys](https://github.com/thecybermind/hidehotkeys/) - World of Warcraft addon that allows you to hide button text showing the keybind and/or macro name
* [FlightWarn](https://github.com/thecybermind/flightwarn/) - World of Warcraft addon that plays a warning sound when you have flown in a straight line for too long, or if you have flown into fatigue. Useful for alt-tab flying prior to Dragonflight.
* [wowaddons](https://github.com/thecybermind/wowaddons/) - Other World of Warcraft addons that are older and not as popular to maintain anymore
